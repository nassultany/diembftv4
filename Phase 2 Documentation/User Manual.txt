User Manual

Our implementation of DiemBFT v4 is run on a single host, where each process is a client or a replica.
Make sure to run with pyDistAlgo version 1.1.0b15 and CPython version 3.7 on MacOS or Windows 10. Also,
make sure to have the PyNaCl library installed for the cryptography elements of the code. Refer to 
https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/ for instructions on how to do so.

To run the program, go to the directory diembftv4

Type the command:
python -m da --message-buffer-size 300240 src\Executor.da
if running on MacOS or Linux, user '/' instead of '\'

This will generate log files in log/ and ledger files in ledgers/ directories.

Our program reads test cases from config/config.csv. In it are multiple test cases separated by '-----'
