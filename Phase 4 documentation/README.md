# DiemBFT V4

Platform:
For our implementation, we used pyDistAlgo version 1.1.0b15 and CPython version 3.7. The operating systems used are macOS OS 10.14 and Windows 10. This program is hosted on a laptop.

Bugs and Limitations:
1. There is a key does not exist error that is popping up but seems it is not causing any harm to the consensus. This invalid access could be in some debug statements
2. We have not extensively tested our code for 7 honest validators with 2 faulty nodes 

Main files:
diembftv4\TestGenerator.da contains the code to generate test cases given a list of nodes and twins.
diembftv4\TestExecutor.da contains the code to run test cases generated by the test generator.

Code size:
Total LOC: 2090
To count the number of lines of code, we used CLOC as suggested in the assignment document.
