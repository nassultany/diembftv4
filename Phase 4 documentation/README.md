# DiemBFT V4

Platform:
For our implementation, we used pyDistAlgo version 1.1.0b15 and CPython version 3.7. The operating systems used are macOS OS 10.14 and Windows 10. This program is hosted on a laptop.

Bugs and Limitations:
1. We were facing errors where nothing was committed to ledger files when testing our implementation with Twins.

Main files:
diembftv4\TestGenerator.da contains the code to generate test cases given a list of nodes and twins.
diembftv4\TestExecutor.da contains the code to run test cases generated by the test generator.

Code size:
Total LOC: 2090
To count the number of lines of code, we used CLOC as suggested in the assignment document.
